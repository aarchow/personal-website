			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>Front-End Developer by day, maker, skiier, barista, musician and reader by night.</p>
			<p>As a certified austrian skiing instructor, I love being in the mountains. Spending time on the slopes and teaching children what I know is my favorite past-time activity.</p>
			<p>I am also a SCAE certified Barista, and have my own espresso machine and grinder at home. I cherish starting my day by making a good coffee.</p>
			<p>Books and Music are my other constant companions. Check my <a href="https://last.fm/user/mxstbr">last.fm</a> and <a href="https://goodreads.com/mxstbr">Goodreads</a> for some favorites.</p>
