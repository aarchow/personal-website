    <h2>Remote Codebase Audits</h2>
    <p>I'm available for hire for <strong>remote codebase audits for React applications</strong>. The benefit is twofold: of course a remote audit will <strong>leave you with a better codebase</strong>, but the much bigger benefit lies in the <strong>improvement of your day-to-day work</strong>. Essentially, this is a lesson tailored around your codebase and the way you and/or your team work which will prevent you from mistakes and pitfalls in the future.</p>
    <p>These audits on a specific form:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>I get access to your codebase and spend a day deeply investigating and auditing it</li>
        <li>I compile a document with recommendations and suggestions to improve the code and tooling</li>
        <li>After you've received and digested the document we have an hour long chat about what I uncovered and to answer any questions you may have</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These code audits have a fixed price of 1,499€ (including tax), half of which is paid upfront.</p>
    <p>If this sounds like something you might want to do or if you have any questions please reach out to me at <strong><a href="mailto:contact@mxstbr.com?subject=Codebase Audit">contact@mxstbr.com</a></strong>!</p>
    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>In case you're new here, a short introduction to myself:</p>
    <p>I'm a <a href="/#talks">speaker</a>, sharing my knowledge on stages in front of thousands of people. I've had the opportunity to talk about React and related topics at more than a dozen conferences all across the world!</p>
    <p>I work as an open source developer, maintaining a variety of popular open source projects. I created <a href="https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate">react-boilerplate</a>, one of the biggest React starter kits with over 10,000 stars on GitHub. It's used by companies big and small all across the world to kickstart their new products.</p>
    <p>Most recently I co-created <a href="https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components">styled-components</a>, a new way to style your React applications, and <a href="https://github.com/carteb/carte-blanche">Carte Blanche</a>, a tool to help you rapidly build and test your React components.</p>
